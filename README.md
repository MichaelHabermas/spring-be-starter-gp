# spring-be-starter-gp

- the backend is inside `/api`
- the frontend starter code is in `/frontend`

## Introduction - What is this HTML CSS JS Even?

## Phase 0 - Backend Running
The backend is inside the `/api` folder. so you will need to follow the [Backend Readme](/api/README.md)

**Phase 0 is complete when your spring boot api runs without errors and you have access to `http://localhost:8080/contacts/`.**

## Phase 1 - HTML Structure
Here we have already created a structure for the `index.html` and `contact.html` files. Your tasks in this phase are to read over the html markup and follow the [Frontend Readme](/frontend/README.md)

**Phase 1 is complete when you have completed the tasks in the [Frontend Readme](/frontend/README.md).**

## Phase 2 - CSS and Styles
You have got this far? Well done, you are getting in to the fun stuff *styles*. Well your task now is to read over the `index.css` and `contact.css` files and complete the taskes in the files comments.

**Phase 2 is complete when you have filled in the styles requested in the `css files comments`.**

## Phase 3 - JavaScript Ahoy!
In this phase you have been tasked with updating the `index.js` and `contact.js` files. Read the comments in each respective file to find out what you need to do. Only concern yourself with comments marked with `Phase 3` ignore the `Phase 4` comments at this point.

**Phase 3 is complete when you have followed the `Phase 3` comments in the `js` files and your front end is pulling data from the `staticContacts` array**

## Phase 4 - Lets GET some `CR` in our Axios
OK so now that you are a JavaScript officianado it is time to flex your JS muscles and use a module. The Axios module to be precise. You are now tasked with moving away from the confines of our `staticContacts` array and will be refactoring the `index.js` and `contact.js` code to allow us to perform `POST` and `GET` operations by way of the `Axios` module. For this phase you will need to follow the respective comments marked `Phase 4` in the JS files.

**Phase 4 is complete when you have refactored the front end to pull data from the back end api using Axios**

## Phase 5 - Learn & Be Curious
For this Phase feel free to style the front end how you see fit and maybe stretch your JS skills by researching how to get this App to be a fully CRUD front end. The back end has the functionality. to get the front end up to speed you will want to read up on axios [HERE](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) and also look at html docs and references [HERE](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp). With those resources and some clever googling, you should be able to get a fully CRUD App! *Remember: For a real super flex, feel free to change the type of App and make your own data etc;*

**Phase 5 is complete when you feel like you have a CRUD App with some styles of your own choosing**
